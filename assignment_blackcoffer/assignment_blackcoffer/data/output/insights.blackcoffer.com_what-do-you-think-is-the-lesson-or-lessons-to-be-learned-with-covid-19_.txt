What do you think is the lesson (or lessons) to be learned with Covid 19?
, the John Hopkins Center for Health Security ran a simulation called “Parainfluenza Clade X” to determine what the potential would be of a virus pandemic, and they concluded: “…
 worldwide–two percent of the global population–
“…
, with the
 U.S. 
, and 
. Washington is barely functioning–the president and vice president are both ill, one-third of Congress is dead or incapacitated.
” 
 (former leader of US Senate),
 (former head CDC), 
(former Missouri senator)–
 and not telling us what they saw in the global virus pandemic simulation only two years ago, and helping lead us out of this mess, with some new simulations???!!!  
The most important lesson to learn is that you always need to keep a spare ventilator in your garage. Your local hospital might run out just when you need one.
